You must write unit tests to show that the data access, storage, and processing components of your project are working correctly. You must create at least 3 test cases and use at least 15 assertions or calls to ‘fail( )’. Your tests should show that you are able to access data from all of your sources, that your database is correctly constructed and can satisfy queries that are necessary for your program, and that your data processing produces the results and data structures you need for presentation.
